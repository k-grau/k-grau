- 👋 Journalist turned programmer. Have a bachelors in Journalism and Media Production from Linnaeus University, Sweden. Worked as a journalist for 10+ years but started to learn programming in 2018 through various online courses at different universities. Really loved coding from the start! 

- 👋 To date I have completed about 2 years worth of programming/web dev/network courses at university level. Currently looking for my first job in the industry. My main focus is front-end and web dev./ app dev. but I enjoy working across the whole stack.

- 👀 Interested in Web development and app development (for Android) with favourite languages beeing Java and JavaScript (vanilla or framework-based). Also enjoy bash scripting but does not do it nearly as often as I would wish. Other languages that I've worked in includes C# and Python. I've of course tried my fair share of SQL as well = ) 

- 🌱 Currently laborating with git and github to learn them properly. Trying to brush up on, and improve, my React knowledge. Want to learn more about web security, networking and software testing. Will start learning Kotlin when time allows.

- 💞️ Any comments and improvments on my code is greatly appriciated!
